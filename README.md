# OpenParEM2D
**Open** **Par**allel **E**lectro**m**agnetic **2D** â€“ A free, open-source electromagnetic simulator for 2D waveguides and transmission lines.

[OpenParEM2D](https://openparem.org) can be used to solve waveguides and transmission lines with arbitrary cross sections and conductor counts for the propagation constants, losses (dielectric, conductor, and surface roughness), characteristic impedances, and fields of the dominant and higher-order modes.  It is a full-wave solver simultaneously solving all of Maxwell's equations, so the solutions are good to arbitrarily high frequencys with a problem-dependent limit on lower-frequencies.  See the Methodology document for assumptions affecting solutions.

The tool uses advanced finite elements (FEM) of arbitrarily high order, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).  An extensive set of worked examples demonstrate a variety of setups and solution styles using rectangular waveuide, coax, microstrip, coupled microstrip, and stripline.

A full suite of documentation is provided covering highlights, accuracy, methodology, user manuals, practical tips, specifications, impedance setup, and suggested areas for volunteering.
